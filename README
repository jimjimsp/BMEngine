BAD MOON ENGINE

So far I've added the most of the architecture, that is:
the game loop, the graphics/window, buffer strategy, image loader,
abstract game object, object id. Basically all the stuff needed for
the program to open up a window and continually update. I've taken most
of the code from a previous game I've made, which means that a lot of
stuff is probably going to have to be changed as we continue to work. But
at least it is something to start with.

I also commented as much as possible so y'all can understand what's going
on, but just ask if there's a problem. I've signed all my comments with /J.
